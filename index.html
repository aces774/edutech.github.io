        <blockquote>
            <p class="hidden-xs hidden-sm hidden-md">The EduTech Summer Camp has been providing summer fun to children between the ages of 3 – 16 years since 1994. Our comprehensive summer programme incorporates sporting activities such as swimming, golf, football, fencing, badminton, and basketball
                along with the visual and performing arts, gymnastics, and computer science. Each year, camp administrators introduce new and innovative activities for campers. This year we will be introducing Table Tennis as our new activity. Through
                all of our activities the camp’s experienced directors, coaches and counsellors have helped campers discover new areas of interest, develop self confidence and make lifelong friends.EduTech Summer Camp provides a safe and stimulating environment
                for children and teens under the guidance of our experienced staff. Our camp is held at the centrally located and beautifully maintained Constant Spring Golf Club, 152 Constant Spring Road. Throughout the four weeks, campers will take
                part in a variety of fun challenges, competitions, special projects and field trips. Our camp culminates with a grand concert and prize giving which showcases the talents and newly acquired skills of campers. Parents are more than welcome
                to view these events and to watch their children in action! In addition to the scheduled activities, EduTech offers a day outing that takes campers off site to interesting and fun locations across Jamaica.At EduTech Summer Camp, we believe
                that our role is to enhance your child’s personal growth and development while providing a safe, fun and caring environment. We have a medical team of doctors on call and a nurse on site at all times. We take this role very seriously and
                we strive very hard to ensure that each camper has an unforgettable summer experience.</p>
